## Node Installation

### Install Node.js

Install Node.js using your favourite package manager, or [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) it. The workshop is tested with version 12.1.0, but should also work for older (not to old) versions.

### Install dependencies

Open your terminal and navigate to the `node-backend` folder. Then run

```bash
npm install
```

### Start GraphQL server

To start the server, run

```bash
npm run start
```

and open [http://localhost:4000]() in the browser.

You are now ready to start doing the exercises.

**Remember to restart the server after doing changes to the code.**
